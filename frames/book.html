The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. 
The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.
According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. 
It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and 
earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). 
In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. 
According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even more ancient root:
 a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). 
This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Today, travel may or may not be much easier depending upon the
 destination you choose (e.g. Mt. Everest, the Amazon rainforest), how you plan to get there (tour bus, cruise ship, or oxcart), and whether you 
decide to "rough it" (see extreme tourism and adventure travel). "There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world traveler", 
notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the cultures and sociology of travel has noted.

While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological 
advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.
The evolution of technology in such diverse fields as horse tack and bullet trains has contributed to this trend.
While travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, it was important to the economy and to society. 
The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravan or sea-voyagers, end-user 
retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues and
 wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, travelling minstrels practised the never-ending tour,
 and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.
Pilgrimages involved streams of travellers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally.
Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. 
Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century.

Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety.
When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to difficulties, 
crime and violence.Some safety considerations include being aware of one's surroundings, avoiding being the target of a crime,
 leaving copies of one's passport and itinerary information with trusted people,
 obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign country.
Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most countries accept international driving permits.
 Automobile insurance policies issued in one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries,
 and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited.
 It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving-rules and -regulations of destination countries.
Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.
There are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel (based on a DETR survey in October 2000).

There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to a favorite place. People of all ages, from all countries, travel to foreign places for many different reasons – namely work, family and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or automobile, travel is generally a pleasurable experience, at least for the people who can financially afford comfortable and safe methods of travel. But it has more benefits than satisfying one’s need to make money, as well as to see loved ones and enjoy one’s self on vacation. There are other benefits of traveling that many people often overlook.

Travel reminds those paying attention that they are not the only ship in the sea, that this is a huge world and that they are only a small, insignificant pea in it. This is quite a humbling experience – to go to another country and see large numbers of peoples living differently, and coming to understand how large the crazy world actually is. When people who learn return home, they keep with them this perspective for the rest of their life and they benefit from this is knowledge and perspective.
Another benefit to traveling is coming to see one’s native country in a different light, in a different way. This is done through being able to compare and contrast home from a foreign location, done most always through traveling. A new perspective may be formed.
 Away from home, one comes to understand what “home” actually is and what it means. 
Perhaps their native country is not as free as they had been told or originally thought it to be, for example. One does not understand what it means to be a citizen of their native country until they have seen it from a distance, from another, completely different country. When traveling elsewhere and having to live according to a foreign place’s laws and social norms, one immediately thinks of how things are done in their own country and culture and begins to favor one way or another. This changes how one feels about their native country, whether in a better or worse light. This notion can be applied to various characteristics, such women’s rights, human rights, customs and traditions, beliefs, a trust of government, etc. Traveling is always beneficial for the individual experiencing it.

<p>
his forces them to be adventurous, to live life to the fullest, to take the most of this precious gift of life and use the time they have to discover new things, meet new people and experience a completely different life – much like people experience when reading fictional stories: They get to become whoever they are reading about, just like in travel they get to become the citizens of the country they are visiting, even if for just a short time. They live outside themselves.
To conclude, traveling is good for a person of any age. It not only helps people to form a better understanding of themselves, their beliefs and their lives, it also provides people with a better understanding of the world in which they live, even if it's beyond their immediate environment. And it may even help a person to feel connected to the many people living in the world, even if their lives never meet, even if their lives are so completely different that they may as well be from different planets.
